## News

- (02/2026) Our article *Unlinkability and History Preserving Bisimilarity* with [Ross Horne](https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/ross.horne/), [Christian Johansen](https://christian.johansenresearch.info/) and [Sjouke Mauw](https://satoss.uni.lu/members/sjouke/) has been accepted by *Computers & Security* and [is now available](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2025.104819) ([also as a pre-print](https://par.nsf.gov/biblio/10661290)). As we write,

     > To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a compelling security application has emerged for [history-preserving bisimilarity], which was originally developed in the early days of concurrency theory as a process semantics to better capture concurrency.

     Another interesting insight from this paper is that, for the first time, we report a violation of unlinkability that requires *bi*similarity and cannot simply be built using simple *si*milarity.

     On the same topic,  [Iain Phillips](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~iccp/), [Irek Ulidowski](https://www.cs.le.ac.uk/people/iulidowski/) and I hope to submit soon an extended version of our article published at [CORSE](https://www.discotec.org/2025/satellite/corse) covering the links between history-preserving bisimulation and reversibility.

## Presentation

The CinRC project aims at improving current specification languages for concurrent, reversible programs and protocols.
It is an international collaborative project funded by the [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2242786), taking primarily place in the [Augusta University's School of Computer Science](https://www.augusta.edu/ccs/).

Augusta University wrote [an article presenting the project](https://jagwire.augusta.edu/augusta-university-professor-receives-national-science-foundation-grant-for-groundbreaking-research/), and our local television station [aired a short segment](https://www.wrdw.com/2023/05/12/augusta-university-receives-grant-cyber-research-project/) about it as well.

### Major Revision

- Clément Aubert. The Correctness of Concurrencies in (Reversible) Concurrent Calculi. 2023. [⟨hal-03950347⟩](https://hal.science/hal-03950347v1). Submitted to [JLAMP](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-logical-and-algebraic-methods-in-programming/), major revision required.

The revision essentially requires to clarify the connection between the general principle sketched in the beginning of the paper and its articulation to CCSK.
I look forward to clarifying this question and to refer to the related approaches suggested by the reviewers.
