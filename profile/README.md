# Concurrency In Reversible Computations

## Presentation

The CinRC project aims at improving current specification languages for concurrent, reversible programs and protocols.
It is an international collaborative project funded by the [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2242786), taking primarily place in the [Augusta University's School of Computer Science](https://www.augusta.edu/ccs/).

[The project is currently actively looking for candidates for post-doc and PhD positions](https://spots.augusta.edu/caubert/research/cinrc/phd_ad.html).

## Papers

### Accepted

- Clément Aubert. Replications in Reversible Concurrent Calculi (Short paper). Accepted to [RC 2023](https://reversible-computation-2023.github.io/site/accepted.html).

### Major Revision

- Clément Aubert. The Correctness of Concurrencies in (Reversible) Concurrent Calculi. 2023. [⟨hal-03950347⟩](https://hal.science/hal-03950347v1). Submitted to [JLAMP](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-logical-and-algebraic-methods-in-programming/), major revision required.

The revision essentially requires to clarify the connection between the general principle sketched in the beginning of the paper and its articulation to CSSK.
I look forward to clarifying this question and to refer to the related approaches suggested by the reviewers.
