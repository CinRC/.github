# Concurrency In Reversible Computations

## Presentation

The CinRC project aims at improving current specification languages for concurrent, reversible programs and protocols.
It is an international collaborative project funded by the [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2242786), taking primarily place in the [Augusta University's School of Computer Science](https://www.augusta.edu/ccs/).
