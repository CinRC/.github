## News

- (10/2024) Our pre-print with [Iain Phillips](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~iccp/) and [Irek Ulidowski](https://www.cs.le.ac.uk/people/iulidowski/) is [available on arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14699). Also, Nate Schwartz will be presenting our work on reversible $\lambda$-calculus at the [2025 Joint Mathematics Meetings](https://meetings.ams.org/math/jmm2025/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/45958) in Seattle, WA.
- (05/2024) I have [a PhD position available](https://spots.augusta.edu/caubert/research/cinrc/phd_ad.html) (dead-line: June 10th), and I am excited to prepare for my [visit to the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters](https://secureconcur.academy/).
- (04/2024) Dr. Medić’s [itinerary](https://spots.augusta.edu/caubert/2024_Medic_Visit/) is on-line!
- (01/2024) I am extremely glad to report that [Doriana Medić](https://alpha.di.unito.it/doriana-medic/) will be invited to [Augusta University](https://www.augusta.edu/) April 20--29, 2024!

## Presentation

The CinRC project aims at improving current specification languages for concurrent, reversible programs and protocols.
It is an international collaborative project funded by the [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2242786), taking primarily place in the [Augusta University's School of Computer Science](https://www.augusta.edu/ccs/).

Augusta University wrote [an article presenting the project](https://jagwire.augusta.edu/augusta-university-professor-receives-national-science-foundation-grant-for-groundbreaking-research/), and our local television station [aired a short segment](https://www.wrdw.com/2023/05/12/augusta-university-receives-grant-cyber-research-project/) about it as well.

### Major Revision

- Clément Aubert. The Correctness of Concurrencies in (Reversible) Concurrent Calculi. 2023. [⟨hal-03950347⟩](https://hal.science/hal-03950347v1). Submitted to [JLAMP](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-logical-and-algebraic-methods-in-programming/), major revision required.

The revision essentially requires to clarify the connection between the general principle sketched in the beginning of the paper and its articulation to CSSK.
I look forward to clarifying this question and to refer to the related approaches suggested by the reviewers.
