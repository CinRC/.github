## Presentation

The CinRC project aims at improving current specification languages for concurrent, reversible programs and protocols.
It is an international collaborative project funded by the [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2242786), taking primarily place in the [Augusta University's School of Computer Science](https://www.augusta.edu/ccs/).

Augusta University wrote [an article presenting the project](https://jagwire.augusta.edu/augusta-university-professor-receives-national-science-foundation-grant-for-groundbreaking-research/), and our local television station [aired a short segment](https://www.wrdw.com/2023/05/12/augusta-university-receives-grant-cyber-research-project/) about it as well.


## Members

This project is carried out by [Clément Aubert](https://spots.augusta.edu/caubert/), with the help of the following collaborators (in alphabetical order):

- [Peter Browning](https://peterjbrowning.com/) (Augusta University, USA),
- [Doriana Medić](https://alpha.di.unito.it/doriana-medic/) (University of Turin, Italy),
- [Claudio Antares Mezzina](https://sites.google.com/view/claudio-mezzina) (University of Urbino, Italy),
- [Jorge A. Pérez](https://www.jperez.nl/) (University of Groningen, The Netherlands),
- [Emilio Tuosto](https://cs.gssi.it/emilio.tuosto/) (Gran Sasso Science Institute, Italy),
- [Daniele Varacca](https://www.lacl.fr/~dvaracca/) (Université Paris Est - Créteil, France).

Quan Long and [Deivid Vale](https://deividrvale.github.io/) were offered the PhD and post-doctoral positions, respectively, and will join the project in January 2024 and July 2024, respectively.

## Papers

### Accepted

- Clément Aubert. Replications in Reversible Concurrent Calculi (Short paper). Accepted to [RC 2023](https://reversible-computation-2023.github.io/site/accepted.html).
- Clément Aubert and Peter Browning. Implementation of Reversible Distributed Calculus (tool demonstration paper). [⟨hal-04035458⟩](https://hal.science/hal-04035458v1). Accepted to [RC 2023](https://reversible-computation-2023.github.io/site/accepted.html).

### Major Revision

- Clément Aubert. The Correctness of Concurrencies in (Reversible) Concurrent Calculi. 2023. [⟨hal-03950347⟩](https://hal.science/hal-03950347v1). Submitted to [JLAMP](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-logical-and-algebraic-methods-in-programming/), major revision required.

The revision essentially requires to clarify the connection between the general principle sketched in the beginning of the paper and its articulation to CSSK.
I look forward to clarifying this question and to refer to the related approaches suggested by the reviewers.
