# PhD and Post-doctoral Positions Available in Formal Methods for Reversible Concurrent Calculi

TL;DR
-------

Candidates interested in a PhD in formal and algebraic methods for concurrent, reversible computation in Augusta University (Georgia, USA), starting in January 2024 are invited to apply by June 1st, 2023 (applications will be considered until the position is filled).
A post-doctoral position will open shortly after, but interested candidates should feel encouraged to reach out to <clement.aubert@math.cnrs.fr> informally.

In addition to accepting applications, I will be very happy to respond to informal inquiries about any aspect of the position, from technical ones to ones about life in the US "Garden City".

Thanks for forwarding this offer to potentially interested candidates.


Expanded version (PhD position)
------------------------------------

The Concurrency In Reversible Computations (<https://github.com/CinRC>) project is actively seeking a PhD student to fund starting Spring 2024. The funding for an admitted PhD student includes waiver of most tuition (only $25--$640 / semester is due by the student), a stipend ($29K / year), health benefits for the individual, (international) conference travel and possibly equipment (laptop). Funding is currently available for the first three years of the appointment through a new NSF funded project (<https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2242786>).

The main goals of this project are to improve existing process calculi formalizing reversible computations. In the past, reversible calculi have shed a new light on the correctness and adequation of CCS, π-calculus and other formalisms for concurrent computation, but they still miss crucial features. Contextual equivalences, observable behaviors, set of operators and infinite behavior, to name a few, are still in the flux and in need of formal definitions that adequately models interesting systems. The original project encompasses many different dimensions, and will be tailored based on mutual interests, capacities, and recent progresses.

The successful applicant will be advised by Clément Aubert, and benefit from an international network of collaborators, as well as from a local, lively, group of PhD students (including but not limited to students working on related formal methods). In addition, they will have the opportunity to help mentoring undergraduate research assistants if they wish to do so.

Interested students should meet the following:

   - Be interested in the overall project as stated above. A complete project description or selected publications are available upon request.
   - Have or are about to complete a Bachelor or (preferably) a Master of Science in Computer Science, Mathematics, or a related field (Computer Engineering, etc.).
   
The successful applicant will additionally need to be admitted to the PhD program by the school's review committee and the Graduate School, but will receive help in completing their application, which should only be a formality.

Students from all origins are welcome, and the University has support for issuing documents for student visa for the successful applicant and their family.

If you are interested in being considered for  this opportunity please begin by contacting Clément Aubert (<clement.aubert@math.cnrs.fr>) with the following information:

   - A brief introduction of yourself and if you have conducted any research already.
   - CV/Resume.

Timeline
: 
   Applications will be reviewed starting June, 1st, 2023  
   Interviews will be conducted in June 2023  
   Successful applicant will be selected in July 2023  
   Formal application to the PhD program will be due by September, 1st 2023
    



Expanded version (Post-doctoral position)
----------------------------------------------

This NSF-funded project also includes funding for a post-doctoral researcher position. The duration of the position is initially one year, with guaranteed continuation by mutual agreement. The position will start at a mutually agreeable date, but probably not before July 2024. However, interested persons should feel encouraged to share their graduation plan or professional trajectory if they believe they can align particularly well with this project, in which case the starting date may be significantly shifted.
